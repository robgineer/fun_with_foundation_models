# FUN WITH FOUNDATION MODELS

This repo contains several useful snippets and code examples related to basics of foundation models


The `ethics_for_robots_101` notebook contains code for a parameter efficient fine tuning approach, where a pre-trained model was updated using LoRA.


The `custom_chatbot` notebook represents a context based prompt engineering experiment where the ChatGPT prompt response was redirected towards a desired answer without re-training the model.
