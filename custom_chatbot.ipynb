    "Chatbots based on Large Language Models are not only customizable using re-training or fine-tuning. \n",

    "Context information is usually provided to the prompt in form of examples or using the history as the prompt does not only rely on its trained model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following code snippets aim to utilize the context awareness of ChatGPT. In particular, the goal is to direct the chat response towards a preferred answer. \n",
    "\n",
    "Example: lets say we want to provide a chat interface for some specific purpose and we want to use a powerful and well trained model (as ChatGPT). Instead of relying solely on the responses from ChatGPT, we want to enrich the response with additional information and explicitly steer the response from ChatGPT towards our preferred answer. This could be useful in case we have additional (proprietary) data (that was not used for the model training) or to \"filter out\" undesrired responses as for chat conversations with minors (where we want to avoid the usage of explicit language).\n",

    "The dataset used contains several tricky questions that even some humans would have trouble to answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Communication using a natural language does not only rely on its well defined rules but also on common understandings, irony, sarcasm, etc. All of which ChatGPT seems to have learned and represent great ingredients for word plays or artistic expessions. We could, for example, request the creation of a poem or a song and most of us would be surprise about the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "Not everything that is said or written is correct, however and we are required to handle falsehoods as misconseptions in our language. Many of which require a deep understanding on the subject of falsehood. Considering that ChatGPT has been trained on huge amounts of data from web pages and considering that most of these are not subject to editorial work, we are expecting ChatGPT to struggle identifying some of the falsehoods in our language. Using the truthful_qa dataset (that was officially not subject to ChatGPTs training), we could provide ChatGPT with an appropriate answer and bias its reponse to avoid falling into the trap of a falsehood; which makes the dataset an interestig choice for a custom prompt creation. \n",
